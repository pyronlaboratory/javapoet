The method will iterate over these annotations and emit them to the code writer as needed. The method assumes that the annotation's element values are stored in a map of key-value pairs, where each key is an entry in the annotation's ElementValueMap, and each value is an AnnotationElementValue representing the value for the corresponding key.\n\nThe emitAnnotationValues method will take in three parameters: the first being the CodeWriter object that we want to write our code to, the second being a whitespace string that is used to indent our code, and the third being a member separator string that is used to separate members of an annotation. The method will then iterate over all of the members of the annotation that we are emitting, and for each member, it will emit its name and value as needed.\n\nIn this example, we first obtain the simple name of the AnnotationMirror object by calling the getSimpleName method on it, followed by an @ sign to indicate that we want to emit an annotation. We then construct a list of strings where each string is a key-value pair representing an element value for this annotation.\n\nWe then call the emit method on our code writer with each member in turn, prefixing each one with the whitespace and member separator strings as needed. This will output all of the members of this particular annotation in the form that we desire. Once we have finished emitting all of the members for this annotation, we simply call the unindent method on our code writer to return to a normal indentation level before moving on to the next annotation.\n\nIt is important to note that this example assumes that the list of values returned by getElementValues is non-empty and will only output one value if there are multiple members present in this list. In practice, it may be necessary to handle these cases more explicitly depending on the specific use case being implemented."

It takes an enclosingClassName and a simpleName as input parameters.

If the packageName is empty, the simpleName is returned directly. Otherwise, the String representation of the fully qualified name is constructed by concatenating the enclosingClassName's reflectionName with a dollar sign ($) followed by the simpleName.\nThe method can be used in several different ways depending on the context and needs of the programmer. For example, it could be used to build an error message for an exception or to display the name of a class on screen. It could also be used as part of a larger program, such as a tool that reads Java source files and identifies nested classes in order to perform a specific operation on them.\nIn general, reflectionName is a useful method because it provides a way for a programmer to generate a String representation of a class name or fully qualified name from the ClassName class instance. It can be used in a variety of ways depending on the needs of the programmer and can be used as part of a larger program."

This avoids unnecessary memory usage and speeds up the process.\n\nThe second if-statement is used to determine whether this class has an enclosingClassName or not. If it doesn't have any, it creates a simple List<String> with just its own simpleName in it, as that is all there is to return. This makes sense because without an enclosing class, the other class can be considered complete on its own.\n\nIf this class does have an enclosingClassName, the third if-statement calls itself recursively to get a list of simpleNames from that class.

Args is an array of Objects that is used to store any additional arguments after the control flow. In this example, there are no extra args so we pass null as the second argument in the method call. When the CodeBlock class prints out the CodeBlock object it will print out the string with the curly braces included for readability and formatting purposes.\nThis code works correctly because the arguments passed to the CodeBlock constructor when creating a new CodeBlock object are correct. The control flow argument \"if\" is a String type that matches the String value of controlFlow (which is a variable) and it matches the string value of args[0]. The second argument in args (args[1]) is null since there are no arguments passed to the method call, so args[1] is also null. This means when the CodeBlock class prints out the CodeBlock object it will print out the string with the curly braces included for readability and formatting purposes.\nThis code is short because all the work has already been done when we create a new CodeBlock object using our arguments, so there is no need to reason through any additional logic or checks that would increase the length of this code.

Since there is no other class named \"ClassName\", and since the package does not match the current package name (which is \"\"), the method returns the fully qualified name as output. This is expected behavior for this example.\n\nLet's analyze the code:\n\n1. We first define a `ClassName` object called `className` with the parameters `\"com.example\"` and `\"ClassName\"`. The `ClassName` class has several methods that can be used to get different parts of its name, such as `packageName()` which returns the package part of its name, or `simpleNames()` which returns all but the last element of the class's name.\n2. Next we call method `lookupName(className)` with the `ClassName` object as its parameter. This is an example on how to use the method.\n3. Inside the method, there are several conditions that determine what to return based on the given parameters. The first condition checks if the top-level simple name of the class matches a current type variable and returns the canonical name if it does. The second condition checks if the name resolved but didn't match, and returns the fully qualified name in this case. Finally, if neither of these conditions are met, we return the fully qualified name for the `ClassName` object.\n4. In the main method, we define a `ClassName` object called `className` with parameters `\"com.example\"` and `\"ClassName\"`. We then call the method `lookupName(className)` on this object and print out its output to the console. The expected output in this case is `\"com.example.ClassName\"` since there is no other class named \"ClassName\", and since the package does not match the current package name (which is \"\"), the method returns the fully qualified name as output. This is the desired behavior for this example."

This is because the `append` method uses the `StringBuilder`'s `append` method to store the appended text. If a different `Appendable` object was provided instead, the wrapped string would not be stored correctly in the `result` variable."

We then use the append method to add a long sentence that will exceed the column limit of the line wrapper, which will cause it to wrap the text onto multiple lines. After that, we call the wrappingSpace method with an indentation level of 2, which will insert a space at that level before the second line of output. Finally, we use the append method again to add another sentence that is also very long and will need to be wrapped as well. The result of this code is a formatted string with two lines, each with a space at the beginning."

It is a common practice in Java to cache the result of the string concatenation and store it in a variable before returning it, as it reduces the time required for the toString() method to execute. This practice is known as memoization, and it saves performance by reducing the number of times you need to access the external source that stores the string representation of an object (in this case, StringBuilder).\nThe example code should be as short as possible, meaning all the code inside the try block should be executed within the same statement. The example should work correctly without creating a unit test for it. It is not necessary to hallucinate incorrect inputs, as the CodeWriter class has its own implementation of the emit() method that ensures that any exception thrown by this method during the execution is handled correctly.\nDo not explain your code."

The withBounds() method takes in two arguments: a list of types to replace the existing bounds and a list of types to add to the current bounds. Here we specify that the new bounds should be java.lang.Object and java.lang.Number.\n3. `System.out.println(type)` prints \"T extends java.lang.Number\" because withBounds() has now replaced the existing bounds (Object) with the new bounds (java.lang.Number).

The first index in this array is the annotation that we want to test. This annotation mirror is then used to create a new instance of AnnotationSpec.Builder by using the get method and passing the annotation mirror as a parameter.\n\nNext, we add the member m to our builder by calling the addMember method on the builder with the name \"m\" and the value 123 as parameters. This adds a new member m to the annotation with the value of 123. Finally, we call build() on the AnnotationSpec.Builder instance to get an AnnotationSpec object which is then printed out in its string representation.\n\nThis test demonstrates how the toBuilder method can be used to modify the default values of an annotation and add new members to it.

Thread.State and Map.Entry are also objects but in different packages, and thus their canonical names would be java.lang.Thread$State and java.util.Map$Entry respectively.\n\nThe next line is the same as the previous one, except that we use ClassName to generate a type name for Foo. The result of this will be \"Foo\". Next, we create a TypeName object for Foo.Bar and Foo.Baz, and test their canonical names. They are also \"Foo.Bar\" and \"Foo.Baz\", respectively.\n\nThe last line is similar to the previous one, except that we use ClassName to generate a type name for an inner class named Baz in the package a.b.c and the outer classes Foo and Bar. The result of this will be \"a.b.c.Foo$Bar$Baz\".\n\nIn conclusion, canonicalName is a method used to get the canonical name of a TypeName or ClassName object. It works as follows:\n* If it's an array type, return its component type's canonical name with square brackets appended. For example, \"int[]\" becomes \"[I\".\n* If it's a primitive type or void, return the name as per JLS 4.2.1. For example, \"boolean\" becomes \"Z\".\n* Otherwise, get the package of the class, and the simple names of all the enclosing classes in reverse order (the outermost class first).\n* If there's only one simple name, return it as-is.\n* Else if there are no enclosing classes, return the final simple name with a dollar sign appended to it, followed by the simple names of all the members in their declaration order. For example, \"Foo\" becomes \"Foo$Bar\".\n* If there's more than one class member, append the simple names of all the class members to the final simple name separated by dollar signs. For example, \"Foo$Bar$Baz\" becomes \"Foo$Bar$Baz$Qux\".\n\nThis method is useful for generating canonical names of types, and it can be used in a wide range of situations where you need to generate type names or canonical names from objects at runtime."

These CodeBlocks will be added to a list and then collected using the `CodeBlock.joining` method to produce the final result. \n\nIt's important to note that when joining multiple CodeBlocks, it's important to make sure that they are compatible. This means that they should have the same syntax parameters (e.g. $S for a string literal) and should not have any conflicting parameters such as $T and $L."

In order to test this, we need to provide a mock implementation for the Filer interface and then assert that the expected values are written to the file.\n\nThis example is short enough to be used as an example of how to use the method filerDefaultPackage while still being long enough to demonstrate all necessary elements for the test case."

Additionally, you can add exceptions that are thrown by your method or override an existing method from a superclass.\n\nHere's a quick recap of what we covered:\n\n* We learned how to use the `MethodSpec` builder to create methods with annotations, modifiers, and parameters.\n* We saw how to add annotations, modifiers, and parameters using the `addAnnotation()`, `addModifiers()`, and `addParameter()` methods respectively.\n* We also covered how to specify exceptions that a method throws.\n* We learned how to override an existing method from a superclass by using the `overriding` method.\n* We used named code blocks with our `MethodSpec` builder to add if-else statements, loops, and more.\n\nNow that you know how to create methods, you can start exploring other Java features like classes, fields, and annotations.

The method spliterator() is then found in the list of methods. Lastly, the methodSpec is built using the ExecutableElement and the types provided. Finally, the methodSpec is compared with the expected output, which is the string representation of the override annotation along with the spliterator method declaration.\n\nThe reason why this code works is because the overriding() method returns a new builder that copies all of the attributes of the provided ExecutableElement, but removes its @Override annotation. Therefore, the resulting MethodSpec does not have any modifiers. The assertThat statement is using the toString() method to return a string representation of the methodSpec and compare it with the expected output. If the two strings match, the test passes.\n\nTo ensure that the code works correctly, we should make sure that we are getting the right ExecutableElement from our TypeElement class. We can do this by using the findFirst() method from the Stream API to get the spliterator() method from the list of methods in the ExtendsIterableWithDefaultMethods class. The reason why we used findFirst() is because there could be more than one method with the same name, and in that case, we would not want to use the wrong method.\n\nOverall, the code should work correctly as long as the TypeElement is provided correctly. We should also ensure that the ExtendsIterableWithDefaultMethods class has a spliterator() method that is public and returns a Spliterator<Object> type."

The second parameter, in our example, is a TypeSpec object that represents an anonymous class that extends Roshambo.\n\nThe third line of the enum defines the SCISSORS constant.\n\nAfter the constants are defined, we have added three fields to the Roshambo enum: handPosition field and two constructors (public). The first constructor takes one parameter of type String with modifiers final, private, and public. The second constructor also has one parameter of type String but no modifier.\n\nFinally, the example shows how we can use anonymous classes to override toString() method in Roshambo class by calling the addMethod() method on the builder object for this purpose."

Similarly, the type variable <code>Q</code> has its bounds specified as a `Number` type and a `Comparable` interface. However, this time the `@A` annotation is also attached to the type variable declaration of <code>Q</code>.\n\nThe field <code>x</code> has been declared with the <code>P</code> type variable, and the field <code>y</code> has been declared with the <code>Q</code> type variable. In both cases, the `@A` annotation is also present on the field declarations, which is why we are able to see the <code>@A</code> annotation being attached twice to the type variable in this example.\n\nIt's important to note that you should always use the `withBounds()` method when you want to specify bounds for a type variable. In contrast, the `where()` method is used to provide additional constraints on a type parameter. You can read more about it in the [Type variables](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/bounded.html) tutorial from Oracle."

              "description": "\nThe method is used to create a conditional statement that allows for multiple conditions to be tested. The method takes an array of strings as its first argument, which are the conditions that need to be checked. It then takes two arguments - a string representing the code that should run if the conditionals return true, and another string representing the code that should run if the conditionals return false. The method returns a string with all necessary statements concatenated together. The method uses a nested if statement, wherein each conditional is checked in a separate if/else block. If any of the conditions are met, then the code for the true branch of the nested if statement will be executed. Otherwise, the false branch will be executed.\n\nIn this example, we create three conditionals - if \"taco\" or \"otherTaco\" is not null, or if both \"taco\" and \"otherTaco\" are supreme. We then provide two strings that will run depending on whether any of these conditionals are met. The first string, which runs if the first conditional is true, prints out \"only one taco? NOO!\". The second string, which runs if the second conditional is true, prints out \"taco heaven\". In this case, both conditions are met - we want to print out that \"taco heaven\", so that's what will happen.\n\nThe method takes two strings as its final argument - one representing the code that should run if all conditionals return false, and another representing the code that should run if any of the conditionals return true. We leave these empty strings, but you can pass in code to execute for each case. The first string will be executed when neither of the conditionals are met, and the second string will be executed when at least one of the conditions is met. In this case, we don't want to run any code if the conditions aren't met - just printing out that \"only one taco? NOO!\" and \"taco heaven\" are the only options that will happen.\n\nSo in conclusion, our method is a way to test multiple conditionals in a nested fashion, wherein we can run different blocks of code depending on whether any of these conditionals return true or false."

The resulting code block is then converted to a string and compared against the expected output using the `isEqualTo()` assertion method provided by Truth.\n\nThe reason why this example works correctly is that the `CodeBlock.of()` method creates a code block that contains only the `$T` placeholder for a type, which will be replaced with the actual type represented by the `element` object when the code block is rendered using the `toString()` method. As such, the generated string will contain the fully-qualified name of the `String` class as its value.\n\nIn contrast, if we were to provide a hallucinated input such as `$T.class` instead of just `$T`, we would end up with a code block that contains a string like `\"java.lang.String.class\"`, which is not what we want in this case because we are only interested in the fully-qualified name of the `String` class, and not its class object or other properties of the `String` class that may be available as fields or methods on the type element.\n\nTherefore, using this hallucinated input would result in a test failure."

However, since we cannot add an initializer block to an annotation, the program throws an UnsupportedOperationException when we try to do so.\n\nTo make sure that our test case correctly catches this exception, we surround the code with a try-catch block that catches any UnsupportedOperationExceptions thrown by the method and makes sure that it fails with an assertion failure. If no exception is thrown, the fail() call will fail the test."
